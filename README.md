# COMP_122
In this project I will analyze the "Titles" dataset which contains information on the Harry Potter books and series. Harry Potter is a popular fantasy series created by British author J.K. Rowling which has been translated into multiple languages for worldwide audiences. The series primarily consists of seven novels, which were later adapted into eight films. The story follows the life of a young wizard named Harry Potter and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley as they attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. My data set contains information on the content of the books published, languages, and library filing procedures.
