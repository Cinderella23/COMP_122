How many different languages were the books translated into and published in?

Based on the analysis of my data, the books are translated into a vast array of languages, up to 30 in total. Moreover, English appears to be the dominant language of publication, with a staggering 81% of all books being written in this language. Interestingly, only a tiny fraction of languages, around 0.013%, are considered derivatives of English, including German, Italian, Latin, and Swedish in addition to the other worldwide languages.

How many books were published in print vs. online resources?

There are 210 books that mention "volume" in their physical description, and 570 books that mention "pages" in their description. This suggests that these books are physical publications. Furthermore, 91 of these books use the keyword "digital," suggesting that they are available as online resources. In addition to this 356 of these books contain illustrated content. Out of all the books, 64% are in physical form, whereas only a meager 0.07% are available in digital format. Additionally, 29% of the physical books have illustrations.


Limitations
I want to mention that there could be some limitations to this project. Firstly, some columns were removed from the dataset because they didn't contain any relevant information that could impact the calculation of totals. Also, the percentages in the data analysis were rounded based on my specifications. Additionally, it's important to note that this dataset may not be up to date, so it may not include information on newly published Harry Potter books or editions. As a result, it's possible that not every single book in the Harry Potter series is included in the dataset.
